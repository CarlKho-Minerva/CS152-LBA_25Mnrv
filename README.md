Study Spot Recommender in San Francisco w/ Prolog + GUI. 

Dove Log â€“ Session Summary

Date: April 15, 2025

Actions Taken:
- Explained how to use Prolog logic in Python for a study spot recommendation expert system.
- Provided a basic Prolog knowledge base and example queries for study spots.
- Updated main.py to use an interactive, menu-based system that asks the user a series of questions (askables) about their preferences (free access, food, seating, open late, WiFi, distance, vibe, power outlets).
- Implemented a function to prompt the user for each askable and build a Prolog query based on their responses.
- Ensured the system displays matching study spots or a message if no matches are found.
- Confirmed the code is ready to run in both terminal and Jupyter notebook environments.

Outcome:
main.py now provides an interactive expert system for recommending study spots based on user preferences, fulfilling the assignment requirements for an interactive, menu-driven expert system using Prolog and Python.
